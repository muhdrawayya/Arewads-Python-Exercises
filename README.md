# **ArewaDS Python Programing Fellowship Exercises**
Welcome to my practice repository for Python exercises from the ArewaDS Python Programming Fellowship.

Each folder in this repository is organized by topic and contains exercises relevant to its name. For example, the folder 04_Module_Strings includes exercises specifically related to working with strings.

Feel free to explore and learn with me as I work through these exercises!
